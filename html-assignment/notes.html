        <dl>
            <dt>ol</dt>
            <dd>"ol" is for making a list with an order. For example: when we have a competition in the rankings.</dd>

            <dt>ul</dt>
            <dd>"ul" is the opposite of "ol", which is for making an unordered list. For example: making a name book of
                our class.</dd>

            <dt>li</dt>
            <dd>"li" is used for items in the list. We can have multiple "li" elements for one list.</dd>

            <dt>dl</dt>
            <dd>"dl" is also a list, but unlike "ol" and "ul", it can have descriptions under the list.</dd>

            <dt>dt</dt>
            <dd>"dt" is associated with "dl", and is used to define terms listed in "dl".</dd>
