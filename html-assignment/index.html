        <h2>Hi everyone~~</h2>

        <p class="paragraph-one">
          ðŸ˜Š My name is Hui Chen, I'm from China. This is my 1<sup>st</sup> time
          to Canada. I love drawing, photography, and traveling, and I've had
          the chance to explore many places like Thailand, Singapore, and
          Malaysia. I have a puppy named MeiMei, this photo was taken when I was
          traveling with her.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-two">
          I worked as a <abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr> designer in
          Shanghai for seven years, but I never had the chance to write code. I
          believe that a designer who can code is much more professional and
          versatile. That's why I'm now working towards becoming a designer who
          excels in both design and coding skills.
